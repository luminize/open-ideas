# How does it work?

- Mounted on the effector (or any other printing device) is a device which can rotate around the axis of the extruder and hot end.
- This device has a slewing ring. The slewing ring can be commanded to choose position (angle) depending on the direction vector of the nozzle
- The slewing ring has an input for wire or tube or whatever you need to have "stitched" to a base or sheet.
- The wire/tube that will be covered/glued will have to be inserted and attached to the other side oof the ring so it will be positionned directly below the exit of the nozzle.
- The nozzle will extrude plastic over the wire or tube
- If the extrudate covers the wire/tube and solidifies there will be drag/force which fold the wire tube at its place, pulling more wire/tube thru the little hole on the slewing ring.
