open-ideas
==========

Here are my "Open Ideas" to generate prior art and prevent patents that will impede me and others in making new machines.

I believe most patents should not have been granted because these ideas are obvious, there is no leap in imagination (inventiveness) or the idea is not usefull. 
All the ideas that I want to share with the world I'll keep in this repository. where the each ideas is put into its own directory.
